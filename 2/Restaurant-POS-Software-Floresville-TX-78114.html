<p>A gift shop needs specialist POS software if the business is to reach its full potential. For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?" Also, keep in mind that even if there are software packages designed specifically for your type of business, they may vary wildly and you still need to research the features to determine what'll work best for your business. Think of a POS system as the convergence point where a customer and a business make a deal.</p>
<p>Some point of sale systems will go a step further—they'll allow you to make inventory orders within their software. As any bar manager or beverage director knows, bar inventory management is the beating heart of a well-run, profitable bar. The specialized POS design lets you keep watch and track employees, edit menus and track inventory. TouchBistro features a good mix of bar-specific features that help you manage catering, reservations, and deliveries.</p>

Former nightclub and restaurant manager, Seth Harris, developed Upserve with specialty ordering and table and customer management. An obvious benefit of making restaurant reservations is that you know exactly how many customers you will feed and when.</p>
<p>It's not all third-party integrations, of course: Within the software interface itself, ingredients can be tracked individually through the inventory management features, a floor plan display helps guide servers to the table they need when they need it, and a menu that supports photos of each meal to be included with each description.

<p>Remote access allows business owners to view how sales are going even when they are not at the restaurant itself. These businesses should look for features like invoicing, e-commerce, and CRM. Proper use of these functions helps pinpoint the causes of inventory loss, reduces "out of stock" conditions and makes overall business management easier.
