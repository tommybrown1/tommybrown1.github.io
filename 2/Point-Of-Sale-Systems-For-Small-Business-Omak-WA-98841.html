<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>Increase your flexibility and satisfy your customers by accepting multiple types of payment. Needless to say, any Retail POS System will be able to receive and manage payments. That's the kind of omnichannel retail experience that customers have grown to expect. Digital adoption — Silicon Valley is packed with early adopters who want all the options, but restaurants on the Rust Belt can stick to a more compact POS with fewer features.</p>
<h2>Easy Point Of Sale Software Solution Omak</h2>
<p>With powerful features for single or multi-store locations, our solutions will help you seamlessly manage your sales, inventory and accounting so you can spend more time running your business, less time on your tools.

<p>The in-store experience needs to be engaging, as increased consumer expectations require retailers to have visibility to inventory across channels. Choosing the right POS for your restaurant is an important decision that will affect your business success for years to come. Lightspeed POS is a good all-round Retail POS System, but a great one for businesses with complex inventories.
