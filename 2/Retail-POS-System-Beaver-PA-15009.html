That's because most of the mobile small business systems are designed to be light, flexible, and cost-effective. Some point of sale systems only accept online payments. The software in some systems runs only for a limited period of time.</p>
<p>Beyond processing transactions, it has reporting and inventory management features and provides access to a variety of integrations that can help you run your business, save time and boost sales.
