<p>When you are just getting started with a new retail business and are wondering whether you should install one or more retail POS software and retail POS hardware, then in this article we will discuss three distinct advantages of retail point of sale, POS, solution over the usual cash register solution. While point of sale systems come in many shapes, sizes, and price tags, we are only going to focus on one type of POS system in this article. It helps to increase sales, improve service, and review reports to check on the performance of servers. Celerant, Intuit, MICROS Retail, Microsoft, NCR, Oracle, and SAP are the most popular POS software solution providers. In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment —a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions.</p>
<p>The platform comes equipped with a robust inventory management feature allowing you to customize categories and settings. CAKE, from Sysco, built its POS to meet the demands of Quick & Full Service restaurants. A member database that supports targeted marketing such as coupons and points schemes has high value in increasing sales and keeping customers. System is hosted online, i.e. data are stored on your POS provider's internet servers, enabling you to access it from any computer browser.</p>

<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
<p>For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. This is very informative details on POS software which would be helpful for Multi-stores.
