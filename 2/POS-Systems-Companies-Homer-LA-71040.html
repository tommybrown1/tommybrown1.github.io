This training is for you if you want to grow your business using a powerful customer experience formula proven to make your cash register chirp.

<h2>Benefits Of An EPoS System For A Restaurant Or Bar Homer</h2>
<p>Routing the Branch — keeping customers happy with an eCommerce POS option to process a sale at a different branch (if the product is not available in one department) is an excellent customer satisfaction strategy. When success depends on superior service, you need flexible POS software and Back-Office solutions for managing every aspect of your restaurant business. Many POS software can be integrated to 3rd party software such as accounting software for bookkeeping, email marketing solutions, and ecommerce platforms for selling online.</p>
<p>Point of sales systems of today function analogously to the commonplace personal computer and can run other software other than the standard POS software that is provided as standard with the purchase of the system. The Point of Sale (POS) is simply the place where a retail transaction takes place-it's the hardware and software used to physically accept payments and record transactions. To ensure that you do not sell to persons below 21 years of age, consider getting a POS system that can verify your customers' ages.</p>
<p>Not only this, customers can avail the software's loyalty features to collect points and redeem these when needed. Another open source POS software option is Floreant The software was created to help a Denny's restaurant in Oneonta, New York, upgrade its system in 2008, and it has been downloaded over 122,000 times. With traditional licensed based POS system, the only knowledge possible to obtain prior to purchase comes from words from your sales rep or doing as much research as possible to find reviews online.</p>
