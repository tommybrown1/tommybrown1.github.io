<p>Integrating the POS system with Apparel ERP will demand an understanding and the need of POS system. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Gone are those days when retailers used a cash register to process sales after which the data was transferred to accounts and stock list. It's a proven fact that when customers open bar tabs, they spend more. Whether you have single or multiple stores, our tools help run your business. A decent POS computer system provides features to manage a large company database, that can be conceivably shared amongst multiple store locations.</p>
<h2>What Is A POS (Point Of Sale) System Duson</h2>

<h2>Restaurant Point Of Sale Terminal Duson LA</h2>
<p>Labor Management and Payroll : A restaurant POS system can act as an employee time clock, with servers and staff signing in and out according to their schedules. In comparison, a customized restaurant POS system bundled with a restaurant POS PC and restaurant POS Software will allow your business do so much more. But when you are dealing with back-office functions like personnel management or inventory, things can sometimes go wrong.</p>
