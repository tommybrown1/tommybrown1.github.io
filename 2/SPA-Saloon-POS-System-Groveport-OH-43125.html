<p>It is a must in retail stores earning revenue above $7, 00,000. Nightclub or bar POS software with preauthorization will also immediately tokenize and encrypt customer credit card information when it's swiped, so no sensitive information is stored on the device. While a cash register only stores money and is often attached to a computer or bar code scanner a point of sale or POS does this all in one interface.</p>
<p>Bluestore is a simple and affordable POS system that works on different types of hardware, including iPads. I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc.</p>
