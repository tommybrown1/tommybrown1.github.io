<p>Bar staff often work without direct supervision and liquor waste and theft is hard to detect or prevent. Many systems also feature add-on modules such as payroll time clocks and customer preference databases. Technological advances such as point of sale systems, email ordering and computerized kitchens have taken fast service to a new level. Flexibility - At this point, many POS transactions are card-based, not cash-based. ShopKeep can be used for payment processing, inventory management, transactions, customer marketing, staff management, reporting and analytics, and more.</p>
