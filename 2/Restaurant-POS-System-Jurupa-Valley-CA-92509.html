<p>It can be challenging to find the right Point of Sale software system for your business. Your point of sale system should be able to manage your customer base, keep up with their buying habits, how often they visit, when was their last visit and what special occasions they have coming up. Your point of sale system then should be able to sort these into groups that should be sent mailers, coupons, invitations to special events or simply told that they are appreciated and asked to visit you again.</p>
<p>Inventory management is the process of controlling costs and waste through effective use of on-hand product. Epos Now is an award-winning POS system trusted by hospitality businesses like Best Western Hotels and Subway Restaurants.
