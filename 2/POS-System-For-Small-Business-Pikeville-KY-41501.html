<p>The Lightspeed EPOS interface is generally user-friendly, but can sometimes be more advanced than intuitive i.e. you may rely on user guides to understand certain features.

<p>However, ShopKeep has a strong set of features that makes it suitable for smaller, quick-service restaurants. When choosing the best POS system for your bar, it is important to factor in the features you need and your available budget.
