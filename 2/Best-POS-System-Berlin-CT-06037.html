<p>One of the main advantages of restaurant POS software is the inclusion of a cash drawer (and potentially an iPad) to be used either at the counter or tableside. Make notes about customers to remember each client's personal preferences and to provide the best service. ETP has successfully executed over 500 enterprise software projects across 35,000+ stores for 300+ brands.
