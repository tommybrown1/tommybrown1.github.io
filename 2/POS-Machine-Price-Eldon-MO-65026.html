<p>As the store plays a larger role, it's time for point of sale (POS) to expand its role, too. Enabling associates to save the sale and inspire customers through personalized selling anywhere in the store. No matter how sophisticated your restaurant software solution might be, it's only as powerful as the people who use it. Make sure the restaurant POS software you choose is easy for employees to use, and that you have someone on staff to manage the new system and train others to use it effectively.</p>
