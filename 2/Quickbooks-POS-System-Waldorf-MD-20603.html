<p>Bar staff often work without direct supervision and liquor waste and theft is hard to detect or prevent. Many systems also feature add-on modules such as payroll time clocks and customer preference databases. Technological advances such as point of sale systems, email ordering and computerized kitchens have taken fast service to a new level.
