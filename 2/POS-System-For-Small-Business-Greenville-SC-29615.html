Restaurant point of sale (POS) software provides restaurant and bar servers an easy way to take orders and process payment for multiple checks simultaneously. A popular mobile, industry-leading point-of-sale system, Lavu POS has a design specific to restaurants and bars.</p>

It also offers software for business intelligence, analytics and customer engagement.</p>

A bar and grill, particularly a franchise where overhead is higher, properly tracking product popularity, sales and waste ultimately improves the overall bottom line of the restaurant.</p>
<p>We focus on making the software work with the best and most commonly used retail hardware and we've heard from retailers using Vend successfully with printers we've haven't heard of. Our POS software is designed to suit a range of hospitality business types, from cafes and restaurants and bars to multi-site restaurant groups and national service organisations. But, using a POS that is tailored to retail isn't wise because a restaurant is a completely different business with different needs.</p>

It combines all basic hardware and software that is needed to serve customers and keep accurate business records.
