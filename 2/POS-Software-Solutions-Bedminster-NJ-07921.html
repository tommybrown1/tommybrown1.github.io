<p>Five years ago I began searching for an easy way to track my customers, my accounts receivable, and all the other aspects of my business. Delivery management: Manage order deliveries from start to finish, ensuring on-time customer delivery. Big and medium sized retail stores are using this application without fail. This is only possible with a faster system of product delivery to the customers. Founded in 2005 with headquarters in Canada, Lightspeed is a cloud-based point of sale system for restaurants and bars of all sizes. Accurate, real-time communications in Retail Pro help you keep your inventory and customer information up to date across the entire business, so you can make better decisions from holistic, integrated business insights.</p>
<p>The system should facilitate the creation of multiple returns for one sales order at different time intervals. Along with an easy-to-use tablet point of sale, NCR Silver Pro Restaurant is a cloud-based POS software that delivers added benefits such as happy hour pricing, customized floor plans and house accounts valued by full service restaurants and pubs. If you plan to integrate your POS system with other software and services - such as accounting software, CMS platforms, customer loyalty programs and appointment management apps - you'll want to find out ahead of time if the integration costs extra, and whether it's a one-time or recurring fee.</p>

<p>The point‚Äù of sale payment is when a customer and merchant exchange products or services completing a POS transaction aka point of sale purchase. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone. Interested businesses can get a quote from the Revel sales team for a customized POS solution.</p>
<p>Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. Our seamlessly integrated payment processing system comes as an extension of PAR's restaurant POS software and is fully supported by our service and customer support infrastructure.

<p>Lightspeed is a great choice if you need to manage sales, inventory, and staff across multiple locations. This allows you to elevate customer service and improve turnaround time when customer orders are quickly entered front of house and immediately available to back of house for processing. Finding the company that charges the least for credit card transactions is key, but you may also need a system that can accept cash or be willing to take your business cashless.</p>
<p>Beyond processing transactions, it has reporting and inventory management features and provides access to a variety of integrations that can help you run your business, save time and boost sales. Unlike the manual inventory system, a POS system can help you analyze your previous sales data and allow you to make better decisions about product reordering. As shrinkage due to customer theft and employee theft is one of the major expenses in most retail businesses, the modern retail POS technology has been geared toward preventing shrinkage.</p>
<p>This is why I recommend taking your time and assessing the various people you will rely on to make the software work for your business. From POS to sales reporting and analytics, it's the best restaurant POS management system available. If you are keeping the pizza delivery part of your business while also running the pizza restaurant, these features will be in addition to the "must have" features from the previous paragraph.</p>
