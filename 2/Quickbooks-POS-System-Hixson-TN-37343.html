<p>All the Point of Sale systems serves the purpose of keeping a close track of daily sales. Shopify POS is an iPad and iPhone-based point of sale application that allows you to manage your entire online and physical store business using a unified platform.

Not all Point of Sale (POS) solutions are the same, and each business needs slightly different features when choosing a POS machine.
