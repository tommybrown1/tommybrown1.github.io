<p>Point of sale equipment is an essential tool required for the management of a business' day to day operations. A POS system has features that support the rationalization of a small or large retail business's day to day operations.

However, POS software is quite scalable and modules can be added for accounting, inventory and even customer relationship management (CRM.) Value priced software choices are available that can give a small shop owner some of the tools the large fortune 500 retailers use.</p>
