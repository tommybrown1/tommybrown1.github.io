<p>Choosing the right retail point of sale system and software is not a decision to take lightly. This means that, in order to access the capabilities that point of sale systems boast, you'll have to pay a fee to access the software that provides them. Cloud POS from an organization like Oracle gives you the benefit of millions of dollars of investment in data security hardware and software, which helps protect your guests and your business from hackers. This helps retailers keep track of their customers' purchases and allow them to serve them better.</p>
