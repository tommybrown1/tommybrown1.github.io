<p>It works with all major credit card processors and POS equipment. Customers can also interact directly with POS systems, particularly in the hospitality industry. Options like an online appointment calendar, appointment reminders, customer database with details for a previous haircut or nails styles, retail functionality, inventory management, online employee scheduling, and employee management are all vital to have.</p>

GiftLogic is Windows-based POS software for retailers. Infinity POS is a comprehensive retail POS system which lets you control it all centrally or at store level - permissions, return and refund validation, discounting and cash management.</p>
