<h3>Best Point Of Sale (POS) Systems For Restaurants Davisburg Michigan</h3>
<p>Another fast-growing standard is the near-field communications (NFC) transaction, which is an electronic payment system being popularized by mobile giants such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet Making sure your POS system candidate can handle these new emerging systems is only half of the equation. They offer a multi-tier loyalty feature which permits business owners to track how much their customers spend, and offer rewards as they seem fit.</p>
<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle. Bottom Line: Paying with your iPhone via the Apple Pay mobile-payment system is a convenient and secure experience, but for now it's not possible all that often.</p>
