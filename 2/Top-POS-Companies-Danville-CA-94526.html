<p>A gift shop needs specialist POS software if the business is to reach its full potential. For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?" Also, keep in mind that even if there are software packages designed specifically for your type of business, they may vary wildly and you still need to research the features to determine what'll work best for your business. Think of a POS system as the convergence point where a customer and a business make a deal.</p>
<p>On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed. While its Square Point of Sale App is an all-in-one software for pretty much any business, Square for Restaurants is rather an optimized version with the specific features that restaurant business owners need. POS functions include employee scheduling and management, sales reporting, inventory management and more.</p>
