<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop.

<p>It means the point of sale transaction or deal that happens between a merchant and a customer at the time of purchasing the product or service. It has a built-in queue capability that handles long lines without the need to take numbers; all your customers need to do is sit back until the next sales agent is available. With the right bar management software and technology, owners and operators can increase their profit margins and better understand both their business and their customers.</p>
