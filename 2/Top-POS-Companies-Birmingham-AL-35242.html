The best POS systems do more than just process sales and accept payments. The software can be integrated with card terminals from PayPal, iZettle, Square, Paymentsense, Payment Express and SumUp, and works with most POS equipment.</p>
<p>POS software is what brick and mortar retailers use to conduct sales. Accept cash, checks, credit cards or even multiple payment types on any transaction. Hence, if you get installed right or needed hardware at your business place, you will get maximum flexibility and speediness in providing services to the potential customers. A proper compliance POS system allows retailers to protect customers' privileges and gain their trust and loyalty.</p>
<p>That said, Square for Restaurants is recognized as the best POS system for restaurants primarily because of its remarkable balance between simplicity and management functionalities.
