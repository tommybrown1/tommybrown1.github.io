<p>Five years ago I began searching for an easy way to track my customers, my accounts receivable, and all the other aspects of my business. Delivery management: Manage order deliveries from start to finish, ensuring on-time customer delivery. Big and medium sized retail stores are using this application without fail. This is only possible with a faster system of product delivery to the customers. Founded in 2005 with headquarters in Canada, Lightspeed is a cloud-based point of sale system for restaurants and bars of all sizes. Accurate, real-time communications in Retail Pro help you keep your inventory and customer information up to date across the entire business, so you can make better decisions from holistic, integrated business insights.</p>
<p>Anything that helps you streamline staff management—and potentially lower labor costs—is a plus. Therefore restaurant POS may boast a customer friendly menu interface to support this. Touch screen menus, remote ordering, staff supervision, automated billing, and organization of customer accounts are all possible with the restaurant point of sale software. However, if the system does not run reliably, it can cause serious headaches for both management and wait staff.</p>

<p>Since it is by default a free shop till system (not including card payment fees), all you do is sign up, download the app, possibly order the card reader, and start using the system. Proper inventory management techniques are critical for any retail business. With an established means of sales control, your business growth can't outpace your ability as an owner to track profit levels against your financial obligations.</p>
<p>A big portion of these business owners are afraid of investing the time and money in a POS system to only end up regretting it because it just didn't work as they had hoped for. It used to be that smaller businesses could not easily process credit card and check payments. ShopKeep's tablet POS system empowers you to strategically place staff throughout the store, minimizing long wait times during peak business hours.</p>
