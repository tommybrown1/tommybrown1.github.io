<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. What Imonggo's free plan doesn't offer is broad integration capabilities, offline access, or the option to accept credit card payments. Once you've come up with a shortlist of potential POS systems, check out what businesses like yours are saying about them. With core functionalities built around inventory management, ecommerce, analytics, and customer loyalty, it helps you boost product management as well as track and organize customer data.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. Retail merchants, for example, can operate with an internet-enabled device, terminal stand, credit card reader, receipt printer, and cash drawer. Once again, here's our quick look at the three POS services that rise above the rest when it comes to features, support, and pricing.

Many restaurant owners are familiar with POS systems because basic versions are usually included in retail or restaurant packages Restaurant systems are normally equipped with a terminal, a touch-screen monitor, and a cash drawer.

<p>With Harbortouch's free POS program, we'd be remiss by not adding a retail point of sale system to our product line of software and hardware products. The user can use cash, debit cards, mobile payments, or credit cards for the payment.
