<p>It is well know that technology has improved our personal lives. As per the business requirement, the mPOS can be connected to external hardware like card reader, cash drawer, printer, and barcode scanner. Vend is EMV and NFC capable and integrates with Vantiv , PayPal , and Square for in-store credit card payments. A POS system also frees your staff from many time consuming tasks, allowing them to concentrate on the most important job at hand - customer service. If you have a chain of restaurants across the world and looking for a restaurant POS software to streamline your business then you can take a look at our eZee Optimus restaurant POS system.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
