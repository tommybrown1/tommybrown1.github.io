<p>You can use the Point of Sales system on both desktop computers and mobile devices. By empowering associates with technology and visibility to real-time inventory, purchase history, online browsing, and cart abandons, employees can not only save the sale with endless aisle capabilities, but they can also increase basket size and same-store sales. Remember that CardSmart Merchant Services has two additional point of sale systems, either of which would be an excellent choice.</p>
<p>Choosing the right point of sale (POS) system is vital for small businesses. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is leading the IoT revolution in retail systems, allowing for end-to-end inventory control, smooth tracking of goods through purchase, and eliminating the need for barcode scanners at the register. For example, if you're opening up a salon, you may want to look for a POS system that can handle complex scheduling and one that can manage payments and tipping to multiple individual employees.</p>

<p>Customers can purchase products online and pick them up at their preferred store outlets, they can order products not available in stores and have them shipped directly, and they can also return a product at the store or have it collected from the desired location, irrespective of the channel of purchase. Refunds and store credit can be offered and Shopify allows for pretty much any payment option you can think of.</p>
