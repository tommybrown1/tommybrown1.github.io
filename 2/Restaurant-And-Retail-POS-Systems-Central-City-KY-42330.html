<p>The newest revelations to take the restaurant and hospitality industries by force - quickly etching its way into "trendsetter" capacity - are point-of-sale systems that are powered by feature-rich and slim iPad tablets. In modern terms, a POS system is typically a POS software product installed on a touchscreen hardware device.

With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entrée or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction.</p>
