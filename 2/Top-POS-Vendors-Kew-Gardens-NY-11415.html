Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>ShopKeep is also less-than-forthcoming about its transaction fees for payments processed through its ShopKeep Payments systems. Online Reservations - The best POS system for restaurants allow customers to make table reservations without necessarily making a phone call. Shopkeep software increases sales and provides your customers the convenience to pay using several ways. Just create weekly and monthly reports of financial statements using a comprehensive restaurant management software.</p>
