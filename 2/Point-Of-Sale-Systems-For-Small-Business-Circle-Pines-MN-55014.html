<p>Any retail store that wants to stay in business for a long time will appreciate every customer that walks through the front door; the question is whether or not they will choose to display that appreciation. Nowadays POS systems are also used in goods and property leasing businesses, equipment repair shops, healthcare management, ticketing offices such as cinemas and sports facilities and many other operations where capabilities such as the following are required: processing monetary transactions, allocation and scheduling of facilities, keeping record and scheduling services rendered to customers, tracking of goods and processes (repair or manufacture), invoicing and tracking of debts and outstanding payments.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. Retail merchants, for example, can operate with an internet-enabled device, terminal stand, credit card reader, receipt printer, and cash drawer. Once again, here's our quick look at the three POS services that rise above the rest when it comes to features, support, and pricing. HDRestaurant will come in handy in those situations, from billing to storing the addresses of the customer; the restaurant software takes care of everything easily.</p>

With an online POS, you can use your own hardware. Toast POS is one of the few providers of an Android POS system, which is more suitable for restaurants due to the flexibility and affordability of the Android infrastructure.</p>
