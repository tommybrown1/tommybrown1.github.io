<p>Inventory management is a necessity in every business, but more and more restaurants are realizing that it can be the difference between success and failure. NCR is a longtime provider of banking services, software, and hardware with experience at handling all areas of tablet POS. For retail businesses, inventory is carefully monitored and set to automatically replenish diminished inventory. The cloud-based Zomato Book POS provides a single platform restaurant operations management. POS Software is a computerized retail management system that takes advantage of the latest touch screen and scanning technologies, facilitating the rapid transaction processing necessary in a fast-paced retail environment.</p>
<p>On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed. While its Square Point of Sale App is an all-in-one software for pretty much any business, Square for Restaurants is rather an optimized version with the specific features that restaurant business owners need. POS functions include employee scheduling and management, sales reporting, inventory management and more.</p>
