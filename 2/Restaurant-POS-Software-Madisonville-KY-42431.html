A huge area of opportunity for restaurants and bars is accurately calculating variance (also known as shrinkage and loss) and lowering it. Bar inventory management software has up-to-date inventory.</p>

Mobility is one of the most popular trends in today's point-of-sale systems because it refers to the ability to move the functionality of a POS software out from the cash register and into the hands of the employees for quicker, more customer-oriented business transactions.</p>
<p>There are a few other special features that TouchSuite POS can bring to a restaurant.
