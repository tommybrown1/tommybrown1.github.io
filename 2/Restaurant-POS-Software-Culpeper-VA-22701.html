<p>In this age of GrubHub, Seamless, Postmates, and other food delivery apps, creating an online ordering presence may seem daunting if you don't want to affiliate with one of the larger digital dining services.

A retail management system (RMS), is essentially an integrated set of digital applications that the retailer uses to operate their business.</p>
<p>So, while your sales associate is looking up stock availability from Retail Pro on an iPad or iPod Touch (or any other mobile device), they can also look up the customer's transaction history and make recommendations for cool sweaters or tees to complete their look.

Generally, if not for aesthetic purposes, the business is only using one of these because they do not have the budget for a better cash management system.</p>
