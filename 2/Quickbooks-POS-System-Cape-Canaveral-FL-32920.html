<p>Point of Sale (POS) Systems have now become the business management choice for most retailers when managing their day-to-day business activities. For a store that generates annual sales, the savings can be significant by utilising a POS system. Plus, with constant staff turnaround in restaurants, an easy-to-use POS minimizes training time for getting new employees on the floor. Omnichannel by design: Manhattan POS is equipped with all of the capabilities needed to turn stores into the center of your omnichannel experience: omni cart, omni fulfillment, returns, exchanges, cross-channel promotions, complete customer transaction and interaction history across channels, and more.</p>
<p>Increase your flexibility and satisfy your customers by accepting multiple types of payment. Needless to say, any Retail POS System will be able to receive and manage payments. That's the kind of omnichannel retail experience that customers have grown to expect.

Founded in 2009 and headquartered in San Francisco, Square markets a restaurant point-of-sale platform with software, hardware and payments to streamline operations.

The software can be integrated with card terminals from PayPal, iZettle, Square, Paymentsense, Payment Express and SumUp, and works with most POS equipment.</p>

Square is a common favorite of mobile businesses like food trucks and boutique retail shops.

Another function of this mPOS is its connectivity to our Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Head Office (HO) software system.</p>
