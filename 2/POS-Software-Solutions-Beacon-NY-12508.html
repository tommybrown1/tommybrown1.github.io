<p>Point of sales systems (also known as POS) are employed in retail stores, medicine counters, restaurants, hotels, clinics and basically any kinds of shops and stores across the world. Some packages are designed specifically for food and beverage service businesses, like TouchBistro and Toast. It can also mean that the system—software and cloud server—must be capable of generating reports such as analytics of sale against inventory for both a single and multiple outlets that are interlinked for administration by the headquarters of the business operation. It has different modules for billing, database management, order token management, employee and staff management, and a lot more.</p>
<p>We created Point of Success Special Edition for independent restaurants, coffee shops, cafes, bars, and quick service concepts like yours. The one thing that can take a long time when hiring a bartender for the first time is training them to learn your POS system. It comes with modules for material management, inventory, billing and kitchen management. Cost-effective - Cloud POS systems generally cost a monthly subscription fee without any contractual obligations - this can remove the entry point for a quality system without spending thousands of dollars upfront for software licensing.</p>

When your sales staff enter the customers' name, they can quickly call up their entire purchase history and their email address.</p>
<p>Payment processors transmit payment information between relevant parties to complete transactions—information will be sent between your business' bank account and the paying customer's bank, for example, or between your acquiring bank and the customer's credit card issuer. Inventory management for restaurants is absolutely essential. Retail Pro International (RPI) is a global leader in retail management software that is recognized world-wide for rich functionality, multi-national capabilities, and unparalleled flexibility.</p>
<p>Its makers, Martin Goodwin and Bob Henry, are essentially the godfathers of modern POS, this being the critical moment that preceded a slew of Point of Sale applications being developed specifically for Microsoft and Unix operating systems.
