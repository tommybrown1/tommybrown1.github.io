<p>There are a lot of products which can be used in the restaurant or food franchising industry and one of them is through the use of the POS systems or Point of Sale systems. Operating a retail store calls for a range of administrative, management and marketing skills. Opting for a POS software provider that offers both proprietary and open source hardware, provides you with the most freedom and flexibility which ultimately results in the most bang for your buck. The cash drawer should be compatible with the rest of the system if purchasing the POS hardware separately. A mobile web study found out that smartphones were used in over a third of total US retail sales in 2018 or equivalent to more than $1 trillion in purchases.</p>
<p>While considered a Point of Sale system, Lightspeed Restaurant POS is much more. It is interesting because you get a feel of sitting in a store and executing your test cases since POS requires setup as you would see in any stores.

Now how the software works is that every time an item is scanned it will be deducted from the inventory database.</p>
