<p>A point of sale machine is a computerized replacement for a cash register. Even if you don't employ delivery staff, these third-party services will order, pick up, and deliver the food, generating more sales with little additional work. For an all-in-one system for taking payments wherever your customers are, pair the Square POS and mPOS systems together to give your business an extra boost. Besides accepting credit and debit cards and cash, restaurants must accept gift cards and mobile payments to stay competitive.</p>
<p>Your customers become your shop's ultimate cheerleader, speaking positively about you within their social circles and essentially attracting new customers for you.
