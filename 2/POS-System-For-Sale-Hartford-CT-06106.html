<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. As a result, POS systems can now be summed up as "cash registers on steroids." Even before the rise of mobile and cloud tech, POS systems took the basics of the cash register and expanded them to task directly to back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors The cloud has become a hot trend in this space because it has let many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) make use of advanced POS systems because they can avoid the ongoing expense of deploying and maintaining a back-end server at every location.</p>
<p>All of the systems are EMV-compliant These POS systems also support NFC (near-field communication) technology, which enables contactless payments through mobile wallets such as Apple Pay. NCR Silver is a cloud-based POS system that delivers big-business features on a small-business budget. It also features a detachable Android tablet, offering the flexibility to serve customers from anywhere in the salon. Live stock by line has been a huge transformation for a company operating in several locations, meaning that regardless of location, all stores are selling items at the correct price as well as having the ability to sell from another location so as to secure the customer purchase.</p>

<p>The point of sale system can be integrated with your other systems and software such as eCommerce platforms, accounting apps, ERP and warehouse systems. Splitting the bill across multiple credit cards is a common occurrence at restaurants and bars.

From desktop to mobile POS to self-service, Intel® processors and technologies power the point of sale and deliver hardware-enhanced security to help encrypt and protect data.</p>
