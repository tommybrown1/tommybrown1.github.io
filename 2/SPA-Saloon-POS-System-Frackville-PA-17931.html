<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>

Your customers don't have to worry about keeping cash in their pockets all the time. This computerized system allows business owners to track sales, cash flow , food inventory and can help simplify your bookkeeping enormously. QuickBooks POS is yours with a one-time payment: no more monthly, quarterly or annual payments to worry about.</p>
