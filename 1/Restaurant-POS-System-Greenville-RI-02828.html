<p>As the world is becoming cashless, more and more business are adopting cashless payment solutions, one of which is automatic payroll deduction. Reliable bar software should also offer beverage service-specific features, such as being able to transfer tabs and split checks and run customer tabs. The module provides reports that save you time and enable you to gain the insights you need to make data-driven business decisions. If you also serve food at your bar and restaurant, chances are you'll need tablets and kitchen printers too. Lightspeed Retail POS has a bit of clunky user interface, but it has all the features that most smaller retailers will be looking for in a point of sale solution.</p>

<p>Customers can pay with multiple tender types and can accept two or more payment types in a single transaction.

Eliminating a fixed bar POS system can raise a bar's customer experience to new heights by creating a modern sales experience that is rife with today's latest technology.

It also offers software for business intelligence, analytics and customer engagement.</p>
