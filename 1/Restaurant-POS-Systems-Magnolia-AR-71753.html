<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>Doesn't offer modules for reporting or inventory management. Reward your best customers with a loyalty program tracked in your POS system. Point of sale (POS) system is the spot where your customer makes the payment for goods or services that are offered by your company.

Comcash offers cloud-based POS software for retailers and a mobile POS app for the iPhone and iPod Touch that can be used as a line buster in retail stores or to take orders tableside in restaurants.

<p>The machine or system used by the restaurant to take your payment is termed their point of sale terminal. Cloud POS systems ensure all customer data is stored properly and securely. Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis.
