<p>With the technology boom, Electronic Cash Registers (ECR) — later termed Point-of-Sale systems — have become this option, expanding beyond the transaction register to cloud-based POS applications that allow complete control over multiple global retail lines. A Guest Manager iOS app can be added to Cake's basic POS software in order to allow online order management. The POS-integrated restaurant management system provides all the tools to run your frontend and backend operations. We present small retailers the freedom to sell, manage daily operations, and grow their retail store business in every way possible. Even before the actual transaction, your employees or you will need to ring your customers up. In this crucial step, your point of sale shouldn't slow down the process—having a point of sale system with an easily navigable inventory catalog for quickly ringing up customers will seriously speed up your checkout process.</p>
<p>Some point of sale systems will go a step further—they'll allow you to make inventory orders within their software. As any bar manager or beverage director knows, bar inventory management is the beating heart of a well-run, profitable bar. The specialized POS design lets you keep watch and track employees, edit menus and track inventory. TouchBistro features a good mix of bar-specific features that help you manage catering, reservations, and deliveries.</p>

Square is a common favorite of mobile businesses like food trucks and boutique retail shops. Either one of these will help brick and mortar retailers switch to an easier to use and more affordable POS. Another function of this mPOS is its connectivity to our Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Head Office (HO) software system.</p>
<p>Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. Our seamlessly integrated payment processing system comes as an extension of PAR's restaurant POS software and is fully supported by our service and customer support infrastructure.
