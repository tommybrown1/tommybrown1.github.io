Your point of sale should help you automate and optimize how you manage your business's inventory. Give your bartenders possibility to quickly and accurately serve customers and create a unique atmosphere for your bar. So, of course, restaurants handled most of their management stuff manually.</p>

<h3>Why A Retail Point Of Sale Is Not An Alternative To A Restaurant POS System Wendell North Carolina</h3>
<p>Traditionally, POS systems were on-premise, which means they used an on-site server and could only run in a specific area of your store. In addition to a full setup with an iPad stand, receipt printer and cash drawer, it offers a mobile POS option for accepting payments at the table. You can accept payment right in the online invoice, and customers can pay by credit card, Apple Pay, free ACH bank transfer, or over the phone.</p>
<p>With Harbortouch's free POS program, we'd be remiss by not adding a retail point of sale system to our product line of software and hardware products. The user can use cash, debit cards, mobile payments, or credit cards for the payment. It can be all too easy to lose track of someone's drink order or miss a customer waiting to place a drink order at the bar. Here is an ugly truth: No matter how credit card improves, cash still holds its position on consumers' behavior.</p>

Retail 4.0 stores such as Amazon Go would shift point-of-sale purchases to e-commerce wherein customers would be making transactions with their smartphones instead of swiping cards. We include a full-featured employee management service at no additional cost. In-store customers account for 50% of all eCommerce activity, research by Salesforce found, so closing the online-offline gap is critical for customer experience.</p>
