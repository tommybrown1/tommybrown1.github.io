<p>Whether you're selling gardening supplies, trendy clothes, or high-end electronics, your retail store's success is largely connected to your cash management procedures. And an open API makes adding third-party applications far easier than with the majority of restaurant POS systems. Customers appreciate when their food is delivered on time, and when their orders are not mixed up. For a restaurant this could mean greater customer retention, and more satisfied clients. By empowering in-store associates with a customer's purchase history, online browsing, and cart abandons, POS can increase basket size and same-store sales, even as you drive loyalty by exceeding customer expectations.</p>
<p>We only sell ruggedized POS hardware designed to meet the strenuous demands of busy restaurants. It is a comprehensive tool equipped with features ranging from order management and payment processing to CRM and loyalty program management. Point-of-sale(POS) systems are vital to running a successful business today. Small bars typically benefit from cloud-based POS software offered on a month-to-month basis. The Epos Now system-hardware bundle includes a touch screen terminal, cash drawer, receipt printer, and EMV card reader.</p>

<p>Customer data capture and management are key in the development of our retail systems and Retail Pro allows for much improved processes and usability in terms of CRM and stock management. For example, having your inventory data visibility across stores means when your store is out of stock on a particular product, sales associates can check its availability at other locations. Food and drink sectors like restaurants require a different set of features in the POS software than retailers.</p>
