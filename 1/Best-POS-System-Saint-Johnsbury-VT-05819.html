<p>POS software offer's your business many conveniences that you simply can't afford to be without. The retail boom has been fuelled by new business model of franchising where multiple entrepreneurs take up part of the risk of inventory. Customize your loyalty program to offer a free product on the fifth visit or 10% off for every $100 spent or even reward a frequent buyer with a discount, store credit, or gift card. With Poster, you can reduce your startup costs and switch between payment plans anytime to catch up with your business growth.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
