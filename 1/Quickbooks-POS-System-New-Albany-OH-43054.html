<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. A good place to start is with your inventory management system provider. Take deposits and partial payments on layaway sales, or let your customers pay on account. This POS software is acclaimed as an easy to use, powerful, and intuitive platform that enables small and midsized businesses to manage single or multi-location stores with total ease. You can follow the spending patterns from room service to reception to activities and in the restaurants or bars at the hotel.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
