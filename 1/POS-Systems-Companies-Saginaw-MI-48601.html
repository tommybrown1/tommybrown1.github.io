<p>Recent research, Retail in 4 Dimensions , shows 60 percent of consumers surveyed want mobile payment options in-store. Different types of restaurants have different software needs, so when choosing your POS system you must first start by considering the type of food service you are running and then matching it up with the system that will be most productive for you and your business. The customer should be able to add to their balance at any time, making the gift card like your own private debit card system.</p>

This simplifies the payment process for both customers and establishments.</p>

You either lose sales or have to rely on your cashiers to add and total your sales properly.

It also features real-time analytics for sales tracking and other key performance indicators with actionable insights. Maybe your store makes many sales throughout the day that involve several smaller items, so a system with a scanner built into the counter might be more efficient.</p>
