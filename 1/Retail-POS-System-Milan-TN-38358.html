<p>The point of sales software is defined by its collection centre which needs to be efficient while collecting tender information, redeeming loyalty points, gift vouchers or coupon codes or applying any bill discounts or promotions.

<p>Any form of payment can be used, such as cash, debit cards, credit cards, mobile payments, and even accumulated loyalty points.
