<p>It can be challenging to find the right Point of Sale software system for your business. Your point of sale system should be able to manage your customer base, keep up with their buying habits, how often they visit, when was their last visit and what special occasions they have coming up. Your point of sale system then should be able to sort these into groups that should be sent mailers, coupons, invitations to special events or simply told that they are appreciated and asked to visit you again.</p>

<p>Lightspeed Payments users receive one free payments terminal to use in their retail store. The QuickBooks POS or QuickBooks Point of Sale is software that works a notch above cash registers. Not all Point of Sale (POS) solutions are the same, and each business needs slightly different features when choosing a POS machine.
