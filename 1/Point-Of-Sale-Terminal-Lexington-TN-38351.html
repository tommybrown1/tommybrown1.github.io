<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. As a result, POS systems can now be summed up as "cash registers on steroids." Even before the rise of mobile and cloud tech, POS systems took the basics of the cash register and expanded them to task directly to back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors The cloud has become a hot trend in this space because it has let many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) make use of advanced POS systems because they can avoid the ongoing expense of deploying and maintaining a back-end server at every location.</p>
<p>A point of sale system is like a computerized cash register, it has the ability to manage inventory, creates an easier system of taking orders, increases profit and will increase the overall productivity of both your wait and kitchen staffs.
