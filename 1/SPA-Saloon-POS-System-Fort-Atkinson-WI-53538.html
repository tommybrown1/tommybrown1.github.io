<p>POSIM (Point of Sale - Inventory Management) produces and supports point of sale and inventory management software for a variety of retail outlets across many industries. As consumers, we see barcodes used all the time: purchasing from any retail store, renting a car, attending major events, flying, and even going to the doctor. We focused our products on two vertical markets; Computer Service & Retail Point of Sales and Restaurant Point of Sales.</p>
<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle.
