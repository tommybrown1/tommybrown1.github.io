<p>It uses a powerful POS technology that allows you to track your inventory in real-time and offer your customers a more flexible payment processing. It is also seen as the preferred deployment method of many businesses owing to the low price tags that come with cloud-based tools And then there is the projected increase in the use of self-service kiosks, not only by restaurants but among retailers as well. Loyal, regular customers are the lifeblood of any bar.</p>
<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle. Bottom Line: Paying with your iPhone via the Apple Pay mobile-payment system is a convenient and secure experience, but for now it's not possible all that often.</p>
