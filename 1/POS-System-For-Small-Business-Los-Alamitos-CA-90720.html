<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. You also get dashboards, retail, and product report to gain insights into your store's growth and sales performance. If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>

<h2>Why A Retail Point Of Sale Is Not An Alternative To A Restaurant POS System Los Alamitos</h2>
<p>Integration with 3rd Party Apps — businesses using POS systems need to make their data available to their ERP and accounting applications. You may, for example, not need a cash drawer if the majority of sales are through card. When point-of-sale systems were first introduced, their sole function was to ring sales by department codes. Why thousands of business owners worldwide choose onetap over the many other hospitality POS systems out there.</p>
