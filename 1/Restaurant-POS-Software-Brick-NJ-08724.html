<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. A POS system provides the latest sales reports for the day, week, month, or year. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. In essence, Upserve POS provides tools for customer management, restaurant management, table management, and specialty order processing. Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out.</p>
<p>Some point of sale systems will go a step further—they'll allow you to make inventory orders within their software. As any bar manager or beverage director knows, bar inventory management is the beating heart of a well-run, profitable bar. The specialized POS design lets you keep watch and track employees, edit menus and track inventory. TouchBistro features a good mix of bar-specific features that help you manage catering, reservations, and deliveries.</p>
<h2>Choosing The Right POS System Brick</h2>

Its tools are fundamentally optimized for performance monitoring, payment processing, order management, employee management and scheduling, menu building, customer reservations, inventory management, and staff tracking.

In addition to POS systems for restaurants, NerdWallet has compared a host of POS systems for other types of small businesses. Modern mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) software and credit card readers let businesses use mobile devices, like iPads, to process customer payments from almost anywhere.</p>
<p>Many POS systems include their own loyalty programs within their software, which is a huge plus. With a broad portfolio of point of sale devices, HP helps retailers and hospitality operators meet customers' needs anytime, anywhere.

Printers - TouchBistro POS system for restaurants supports TSP650 II series thermal, plus Star Micronics Impact TSP100, and TSP100III receipt printers. If customer data collection is important for your marketing strategy, giving associates a way to record data to your customer's profile tactfully from the mobile POS screen is invaluable.</p>
<p>Payment processors transmit payment information between relevant parties to complete transactions—information will be sent between your business' bank account and the paying customer's bank, for example, or between your acquiring bank and the customer's credit card issuer. Inventory management for restaurants is absolutely essential. Retail Pro International (RPI) is a global leader in retail management software that is recognized world-wide for rich functionality, multi-national capabilities, and unparalleled flexibility.</p>
<p>As much as possible, go for a POS that can boost profits by providing a fast and efficient check-out process, manage inventory and sales reports, and provide income generating programs like loyalty rewards and discount promos.
