<p>Whether you're selling gardening supplies, trendy clothes, or high-end electronics, your retail store's success is largely connected to your cash management procedures. And an open API makes adding third-party applications far easier than with the majority of restaurant POS systems. Customers appreciate when their food is delivered on time, and when their orders are not mixed up. For a restaurant this could mean greater customer retention, and more satisfied clients. By empowering in-store associates with a customer's purchase history, online browsing, and cart abandons, POS can increase basket size and same-store sales, even as you drive loyalty by exceeding customer expectations.</p>
<p>The system should facilitate the creation of multiple returns for one sales order at different time intervals. Along with an easy-to-use tablet point of sale, NCR Silver Pro Restaurant is a cloud-based POS software that delivers added benefits such as happy hour pricing, customized floor plans and house accounts valued by full service restaurants and pubs. If you plan to integrate your POS system with other software and services - such as accounting software, CMS platforms, customer loyalty programs and appointment management apps - you'll want to find out ahead of time if the integration costs extra, and whether it's a one-time or recurring fee.</p>

<p>Customers can pay with multiple tender types and can accept two or more payment types in a single transaction. Many POS systems are tailor-made and marketed to specific types of businesses, especially full-service restaurants or retail. Depending on the software, merchants can track not only their sales but also inventory levels, gross revenues, profit margins, sales patterns and a whole host of other data points.</p>
<p>Point of sales systems of today function analogously to the commonplace personal computer and can run other software other than the standard POS software that is provided as standard with the purchase of the system. The Point of Sale (POS) is simply the place where a retail transaction takes place-it's the hardware and software used to physically accept payments and record transactions. To ensure that you do not sell to persons below 21 years of age, consider getting a POS system that can verify your customers' ages.</p>
<p>Restaurant POS systems are crucial to keeping a restaurant running smoothly.

Another advantage associated with Point of Sale software for restaurants is its real-time integration with inventory management.

Also available are additional hardware, including bar-code scanners and receipt printers, to use with the POS software. Our projects range from single-purpose tasks for small businesses to highly complex, multi-platform systems for large corporate clients.</p>
