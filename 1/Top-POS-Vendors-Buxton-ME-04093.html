<p>It fulfills all our requirements and fits our budget, way more than I expected from a restaurant POS software. When determining how much a bar POS system will cost your business, you must first decide if you are going to lease or purchase your hardware. If you are operating a small or midsize bar, cloud-based POS software is likely the best option for your business. And with QuickBooks hardware and software, you can take any type of payment from just about any device—barcode scanner, touch screen terminal, iPad, or mobile reader.</p>
