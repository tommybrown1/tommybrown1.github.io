<p>Mobile-enabled and cloud-based omnichannel platform to speed up innovation and business change for midsize to large retail and restaurant businesses. Cash management is a significant feature of POS software systems, but there are other key functions. For smaller retail businesses, we recommend our new retail POS solution, Harbortouch Checkout HT Retail is designed for larger business environments like department stores, grocery stores, bookstores, beer distributors, or stores with over 10,000 SKUs. You can use them to monitor your business performance, cash flows, employee activities, order processing, inventory levels, and much more in real-time.</p>
<p>A functioning POS gift card program can also help retain customers.

As the next-generation point-of-sale system, with cloud-based service, SaaS architecture, and bid data analysis, we help customers to achieve marketing, operations, management and all-round development of smart restaurants.</p>

The right POS system can make your life easier — and improve the experience for your customers — while the wrong one can really set you back. They do, however, need to concern themselves with how much their bartenders are being tipped and how easy it is for customers to leave a gratuity, especially when completing transactions via a card or wallet app.</p>

That kind of (costly) frustration can't occur in retail stores. Ultimately, inventory is synchronized with less human error that is simply getting you real-time data and result for your business. Without a POS System, your customers will have to stand in a long line to wait for their checkout turn.</p>
