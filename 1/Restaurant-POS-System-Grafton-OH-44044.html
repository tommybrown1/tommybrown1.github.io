<p>There are EPoS systems which have been developed with the hospitality industry in mind. In this day and age, a POS system is a requirement for any business, not just restaurants. Even though different types of restaurants have different needs for POS functionality, they all need reliable support and service to keep operations running. The smart restaurant POS software also allows you to split guest bills by food type and quantity. Mobile payments - In business, mobile payment options have made the transactions more accessible and safer and can even improve customer service.</p>

It offers the Masterdine POS for restaurants and the STORCheck POS for retailers. Keep track of your customers habits and send them special offers and sale notices. For example, Square offers a customer loyalty program where customers earn redeemable points on sales.</p>

Many systems will integrate with accounting software like QuickBooks ( read our review ) or Xero ( read our review ), or marketing software like MailChimp ( read our review ) and some go much deeper, giving you the ability to set up eCommerce for your business or online ordering. 2.

<p>Point of sale equipment allows faster payment service thereby reducing the amount of time a shopper has to wait to pay for their items.
