<p>As the world is becoming cashless, more and more business are adopting cashless payment solutions, one of which is automatic payroll deduction. Reliable bar software should also offer beverage service-specific features, such as being able to transfer tabs and split checks and run customer tabs. The module provides reports that save you time and enable you to gain the insights you need to make data-driven business decisions. If you also serve food at your bar and restaurant, chances are you'll need tablets and kitchen printers too. Lightspeed Retail POS has a bit of clunky user interface, but it has all the features that most smaller retailers will be looking for in a point of sale solution.</p>
<p>Some restaurants are adopting a customer-facing POS with tabletop devices providing upsells and remote service. Using integrated technology to track data helps retailers catch discrepancies in pricing or cash flow that could lead to profit loss or interrupt sales. While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>

The type of POS features we're talking about here range from inventory tracking and menu planning to payment processing, employee management, customer management, and order management.</p>
<p>With integrated payments and remote accessibility from the cloud, the AirPOS is a great bar POS system.
