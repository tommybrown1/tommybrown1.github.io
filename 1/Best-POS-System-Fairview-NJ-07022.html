Vend is EMV and NFC capable and integrates with Vantiv , PayPal , and Square for in-store credit card payments.

If you have a chain of restaurants across the world and looking for a restaurant POS software to streamline your business then you can take a look at our eZee Optimus restaurant POS system.</p>

Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
