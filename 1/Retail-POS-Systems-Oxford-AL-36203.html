Not only do we offer a fully featured PMS for Hostels, but we also provide a highly configurable and feature rich POS solution, with the option of full inventory management. Interactive graphs help managers understand the data collected in the software system's reporting and analytics features. Those are all available features in POS systems. The next consideration is an inventory management system, since keeping control of stock is a time-consuming job.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. Retail merchants, for example, can operate with an internet-enabled device, terminal stand, credit card reader, receipt printer, and cash drawer.
