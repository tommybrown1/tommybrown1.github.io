<p>There are EPoS systems which have been developed with the hospitality industry in mind. In this day and age, a POS system is a requirement for any business, not just restaurants. Even though different types of restaurants have different needs for POS functionality, they all need reliable support and service to keep operations running. The smart restaurant POS software also allows you to split guest bills by food type and quantity. Mobile payments - In business, mobile payment options have made the transactions more accessible and safer and can even improve customer service.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can monitor the sales made by your servers and manage security permissions on the POS. With POS Software you will be able to capture complete transaction details at the point of sale, and transaction history and real-time database records are stored indefinitely so your data is always available for reporting and analysis. Mobile point of sale systems that utilize handheld tablets eliminate the clunky technology that typically stands between staff and guests.</p>
