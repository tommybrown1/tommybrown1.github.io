<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>A great POS solution will not only improve your business, but it will also enhance the overall customer experience. Relying on an iPads is also a big perk, as it saves space and makes it easy for servers, hosts, managers, and bartenders to create and edit orders anywhere. Systems such as Square Point of Sale are known for offering small dongles that connect to a tablet and let you swipe credit cards on the go. While you may not immediately need this type of mobility, it is good to know that it's available.</p>
<h2>Manage Your Small Business Restaurant With A POS System Belvidere</h2>
<p>As your business grows ShopKeep's retail store software is designed to help you pivot with advanced features. But I had breakfast with a group of retailers and I asked them what kind of retail software point of sale (POS) systems they were using. Apart from order management, restaurant table management, payment handling, inventory management, employee management, and menu management, it comes with CRM capabilities- all of which we've repeatedly tried, tested and confirmed that they indeed perform well.</p>
<p>POS software is what brick and mortar retailers use to conduct sales. Accept cash, checks, credit cards or even multiple payment types on any transaction. Hence, if you get installed right or needed hardware at your business place, you will get maximum flexibility and speediness in providing services to the potential customers. A proper compliance POS system allows retailers to protect customers' privileges and gain their trust and loyalty.</p>
<p>Vend is an online retail platform for point of sale, inventory, customer management, and reporting, designed to help inventory-based retailers do more of what matters. Most POS solutions offer some form of inventory management. See what's selling and what's not with detailed sales and inventory reports. The cost of a complete Point of Sale System with all the necessary hardware & software isn't cheap for small business owners.</p>

Our retail POS solution is a very robust and includes a feature-rich touchscreen terminal and software created with automated programming in place to help make your day-to-day business operations much more manageable and to make your business more profitable.</p>
<p>You avoid entering the same data twice as all sales are automatically registered in the accounts. The price, lower than most POS software services in the restaurant business, is also a big selling point. We customized the user interface to include fields for the exact data we need to sell online - things like name, subname, item, weight, dimensions, UPC, and at least three photos which we get from our wholesalers.</p>
