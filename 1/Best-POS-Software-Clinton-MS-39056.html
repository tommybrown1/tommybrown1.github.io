<p>Choosing the right retail point of sale system and software is not a decision to take lightly. This means that, in order to access the capabilities that point of sale systems boast, you'll have to pay a fee to access the software that provides them. Cloud POS from an organization like Oracle gives you the benefit of millions of dollars of investment in data security hardware and software, which helps protect your guests and your business from hackers. This helps retailers keep track of their customers' purchases and allow them to serve them better.</p>
<p>Efficiently manage all your vendors, track invoices, and create purchase orders right from your retail software. Download the app for free and there is no monthly fee and credit card sales will appear in the merchant's account overnight. Personalized marketing solutions like AppCard for Retail Pro use transactional data from Retail Pro to trigger behavioral-based campaigns and keep shoppers engaged with your store.</p>

Because of this, retailers and POS vendors worked to standardise the development of computerised Point of Sale systems and to simplify the interconnectivity of Point of Sale devices.</p>
<p>Despite the cash register motif, however, when people talk about POS systems, they're mostly referring to the software, which could be client-based or cloud-based.

<p>When we consider a POS system, it has to be divided into hardware and software.

Its innovative modular design allows users to easily manage all areas of operation, including the POS, Inventory, Staff and Accounting.</p>
<p>With a kiosk module, you can set up tablets as self-service kiosks that customers can use at restaurants to place and pay for their orders and at retail businesses to scan and pay for their items. As technology has advanced, so have POS systems, with the introduction of bar codes in the 1970s, graphical interfaces in the 1980s, and online ordering in the 1990s. Valuable reporting insights, ingredient-level inventory, and easy ordering will save you time and money.</p>
<p>As the store plays a larger role, it's time for point of sale (POS) to expand its role, too. Enabling associates to save the sale and inspire customers through personalized selling anywhere in the store. No matter how sophisticated your restaurant software solution might be, it's only as powerful as the people who use it. Make sure the restaurant POS software you choose is easy for employees to use, and that you have someone on staff to manage the new system and train others to use it effectively.</p>
