<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>Increase your flexibility and satisfy your customers by accepting multiple types of payment. Needless to say, any Retail POS System will be able to receive and manage payments. That's the kind of omnichannel retail experience that customers have grown to expect.
