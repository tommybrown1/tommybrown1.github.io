<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>Features include sales snapshots, void reports by employee, detailed credit card payment reports and detailed shift reports. Multi-store businesses, such as chains or franchises, will have access to the hierarchy feature, which allows businesses to easily manage and control simple to complex organisational business structures with accompanying access privileges. This way, you're saving customers from disappointment and you're saving sales.</p>
