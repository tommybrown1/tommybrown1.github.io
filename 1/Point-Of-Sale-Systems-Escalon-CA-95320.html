Entry level systems begin at around $500 for the hardware and a monthly subscription price for the software of about $50. The type of POS features we're talking about here range from inventory tracking and menu planning to payment processing, employee management, customer management, and order management.</p>
<p>If you are already using a payment-processing service and want to stick with it, then you will want to look at POS systems which work with that system (usually called "integrated processing" since the outside company's payments are integrated into the POS). Robust mobile sales functionality is offered. A great system also allows nightclub owners and managers to see exactly how their business is performing in real-time, from anywhere.</p>
