<p>Updating your point of sale (POS) systems can help you to provide better customer service, increase your stock control, increase staff efficiency, reduce theft at the point of sale, and provide customers with more information. Otherwise, your business's and your customers' financial information could be at risk. With handheld technology designed for the restaurant environment, you can enable your team to spend more time with guests, accelerate service, and speed up checkout through tableside ordering and payments. For the purposes of calculating the sales total and change due this makes perfect sense. We're talking about employee management, customer management, offline mode functionality, payroll management, customer management, etc.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>

Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
