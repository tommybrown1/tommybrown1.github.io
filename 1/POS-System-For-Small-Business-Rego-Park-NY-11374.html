<p>It's important to remember that not all restaurant POS systems are one-size-fits-all solutions. Eliminating a fixed bar POS system can raise a bar's customer experience to new heights by creating a modern sales experience that is rife with today's latest technology. If you need internal security, manage data access with employee passcodes for checking individual sales and refunds. It also offers software for business intelligence, analytics and customer engagement.</p>
<p>For example, restaurant POS systems include a priner for the kitchen to send orders to be prepared as soon as the server enters them on a touch screen out front.

<p>Regardless of whether you choose cloud-based or local, server-based POS software, make sure the system is compatible with your payment processor and has the add-ons you require. Meet the real side of your retail business and never again blind-guess your store performance. There are many kinds of payment processing solutions available to use such as new mobile payment methods and credit card readers, however, the POS systems we reviewed for this article are full-on cash registers.</p>
