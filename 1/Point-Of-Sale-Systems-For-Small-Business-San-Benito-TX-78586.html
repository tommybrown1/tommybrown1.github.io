Menu management lets you switch between different menus for different parts of the day, such as happy hour. Usually, this is an automated process which is scheduled to run at a certain time interval in real stores.</p>
<p>And unsurprisingly, 71% of Americans think that a credit or debit card is the most convenient payment method. It provides flexible reporting and cost & labor saving inventory management tools that help identify vulnerable areas of the business.
