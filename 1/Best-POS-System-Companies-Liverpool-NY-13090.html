<p>When you are just getting started with a new retail business and are wondering whether you should install one or more retail POS software and retail POS hardware, then in this article we will discuss three distinct advantages of retail point of sale, POS, solution over the usual cash register solution. While point of sale systems come in many shapes, sizes, and price tags, we are only going to focus on one type of POS system in this article.

Small restaurant businesses like cafes, pizzerias, nightclubs and bars can capitalize on the software's advanced menu creation and table mapping capabilities, while large franchises would be more interested in taking advantage of its real-time multi-location data syncing.</p>
