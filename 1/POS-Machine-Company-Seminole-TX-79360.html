So in order to accelerate the process developed software together with an improved hardware will improve the quality of service and increase the level of customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>The system should facilitate the creation of multiple returns for one sales order at different time intervals. Along with an easy-to-use tablet point of sale, NCR Silver Pro Restaurant is a cloud-based POS software that delivers added benefits such as happy hour pricing, customized floor plans and house accounts valued by full service restaurants and pubs. If you plan to integrate your POS system with other software and services - such as accounting software, CMS platforms, customer loyalty programs and appointment management apps - you'll want to find out ahead of time if the integration costs extra, and whether it's a one-time or recurring fee.</p>

This feature helps protect a bar business from running out of product, which can be one of the most damaging forces to an exceptional customer experience.</p>

Meet the real side of your retail business and never again blind-guess your store performance.
