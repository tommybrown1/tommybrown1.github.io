<p>The mPOS gives you the opportunity to accept payments anywhere in your store, look up inventory availability and find product information without leaving the customer's side. With real-time restaurant inventory software, you can track your food inventory, suppliers, units, and prices on your computer, phone, or tablet so you know what to reorder and when — without having to spend long hours updating a spreadsheet.</p>

Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
<p>Checkout times are fast-tracked by meeting customers where they are. Retail businesses can use the system for both stationary and mobile devices.
