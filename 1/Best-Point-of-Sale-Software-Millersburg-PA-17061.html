<p>Most of us remember the early days when retail systems were just a cash register. Hardware — Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers. You can download and install Retail Plus POS software in a matter of minutes. By setting minimum stock number and restocking levels a restaurant can maximize their revenue by creating accurate orders that reflect the sales patterns the software reveals. ShopKeep helps small business owners focus on providing excellent customer service by minimizing the time it takes to complete routine tasks.</p>
<p>Some point of sale systems will go a step further—they'll allow you to make inventory orders within their software. As any bar manager or beverage director knows, bar inventory management is the beating heart of a well-run, profitable bar. The specialized POS design lets you keep watch and track employees, edit menus and track inventory. TouchBistro features a good mix of bar-specific features that help you manage catering, reservations, and deliveries.</p>

<p>Thus should the remote server fail, the cashier can switch over to the local sale window without disrupting sales. Many systems will integrate with accounting software like QuickBooks ( read our review ) or Xero ( read our review ), or marketing software like MailChimp ( read our review ) and some go much deeper, giving you the ability to set up eCommerce for your business or online ordering. 2.
