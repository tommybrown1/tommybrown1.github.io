<p>Trying to manage and grow a restaurant using old, antiquated processes like hand written order slips is a huge waste of time and energy. A credit card swipe is integrated with the POS system to quickly and accurately approve the customer's credit card and to input the transaction into the system. IVend POS is Windows OS based software that allows for a variety of peripherals and device configurations, including scanners, cash drawers, displays and EMV-compliant card readers. That's because it's the software that lets you track sales, issue receipts, and perform back-office functions.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
