<p>Technology has been moving at an amazing avalanche pace. This POS system has SMS messaging, inventory management, and loyalty programs, compatible with PC, Mac, iPhone, and Windows Mobile.

The most basic and universal in-person payment method is the reading of a credit card magstripe via swipe. Keep a track of inventory and enjoy smooth sales operation. Keep customers coming back with seamless shopping experiences both in store and online.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
