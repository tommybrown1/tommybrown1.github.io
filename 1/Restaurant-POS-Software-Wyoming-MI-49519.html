<p>The sole purpose of any Point of Sale System setup by any store is to improve sales and profits by keeping track of all the products being sold or purchased at the retail store. You can close out or reconcile your cash drawer at any time and even have multiple shifts and multiple point of sale operators per shift. As point of sale systems evolved, they became more computerised, storing a product database on a computer server.</p>
<p>My previous experience was also in e-commerce, so I'd seen the first-hand benefits that retail technology could have when it came to time savings and sales insights. Menu building — Building a menu can be a complex endeavor, but restaurant POS systems allow you to see your inventory and build a menu that's appropriate. Before the POS was introduced, businesses used old-school cash tills or registers to manually process transactions.</p>
