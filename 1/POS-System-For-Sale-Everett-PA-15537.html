<p>When you are just getting started with a new retail business and are wondering whether you should install one or more retail POS software and retail POS hardware, then in this article we will discuss three distinct advantages of retail point of sale, POS, solution over the usual cash register solution. While point of sale systems come in many shapes, sizes, and price tags, we are only going to focus on one type of POS system in this article. It helps to increase sales, improve service, and review reports to check on the performance of servers. Celerant, Intuit, MICROS Retail, Microsoft, NCR, Oracle, and SAP are the most popular POS software solution providers. In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment â€”a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions.</p>
<p>We only sell ruggedized POS hardware designed to meet the strenuous demands of busy restaurants. It is a comprehensive tool equipped with features ranging from order management and payment processing to CRM and loyalty program management. Point-of-sale(POS) systems are vital to running a successful business today. Small bars typically benefit from cloud-based POS software offered on a month-to-month basis. The Epos Now system-hardware bundle includes a touch screen terminal, cash drawer, receipt printer, and EMV card reader.</p>

<p>You can use the Point of Sales system on both desktop computers and mobile devices. By empowering associates with technology and visibility to real-time inventory, purchase history, online browsing, and cart abandons, employees can not only save the sale with endless aisle capabilities, but they can also increase basket size and same-store sales. Remember that CardSmart Merchant Services has two additional point of sale systems, either of which would be an excellent choice.</p>
<p>With Harbortouch's free POS program, we'd be remiss by not adding a retail point of sale system to our product line of software and hardware products. The user can use cash, debit cards, mobile payments, or credit cards for the payment. It can be all too easy to lose track of someone's drink order or miss a customer waiting to place a drink order at the bar. Here is an ugly truth: No matter how credit card improves, cash still holds its position on consumers' behavior.</p>

The retail stores are cozier and less stressful for shoppers. Manage and view customers' order history and personal information.
