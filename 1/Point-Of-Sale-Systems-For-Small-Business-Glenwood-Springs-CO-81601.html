<p>ShopKeep also runs on Clover devices, such as Clover Station and Clover Mini Though it doesn't include as many industry-specific features as some other systems, ShopKeep has an affordable price point (monthly rates are customized for each business) and has a lot to offer in the areas of inventory and employee management.
