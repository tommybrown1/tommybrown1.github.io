<p>A gift shop needs specialist POS software if the business is to reach its full potential. For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?" Also, keep in mind that even if there are software packages designed specifically for your type of business, they may vary wildly and you still need to research the features to determine what'll work best for your business. Think of a POS system as the convergence point where a customer and a business make a deal.</p>
<p>Lavu offers several features that allow customization of menu layouts, easier staff training, and quicker order taking. provides credit card processing services and equipment to retailers, restaurants and online merchants. From the console, retailers can create products, check stock, change prices, run sales reports, and more.

<p>The most prominent makers of iPad POS systems also piggyback their point-of-sale solutions with digital menus that are powered by the iPad tablets. The small businesses hold the basic features of the POS system, so their prices are more affordable rather than the large organizations that believe in investing in the plans that offer more advanced features. In short the software makes running the retail store easily and conveniently.</p>
