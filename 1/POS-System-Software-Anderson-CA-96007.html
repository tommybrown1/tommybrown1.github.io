<p>Choosing your point of sale, or POS, systems could be a disaster if you approach the wrong dealer and go for the wrong equipment. This training is for you if you want to grow your business using a powerful customer experience formula proven to make your cash register chirp. The number one reason customers get unhappy with a retail store is a long queue at the check-out. Its POS systems include inventory management, delivery tracking, time tracking and marketing tools. Combined with Upserves HQ and Upserve Payments, Upserve POS delivers the most advanced POS and restaurant management solution in the industry, purpose-built to improve guest experiences.</p>
<p>The system features automatic invoicing, barcode scanning, debit card PIN processing and digital receipts. A small business should not have to pay for an entire support division just for their point of sale software. Bluestore Live offers retailers a flexible point of sale system that can run on different hardware. We know how many hats business owners wear each day and created an ePOS software and eCommerce system that simply works well and works right, while enabling a competitive advantage.</p>

Tracking sales and inventory, renting videos and equipment, creating membership accounts, look ups by category, and managing your store's books are just a few of the features.
