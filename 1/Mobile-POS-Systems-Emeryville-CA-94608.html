<p>When you are just getting started with a new retail business and are wondering whether you should install one or more retail POS software and retail POS hardware, then in this article we will discuss three distinct advantages of retail point of sale, POS, solution over the usual cash register solution. While point of sale systems come in many shapes, sizes, and price tags, we are only going to focus on one type of POS system in this article. It helps to increase sales, improve service, and review reports to check on the performance of servers. Celerant, Intuit, MICROS Retail, Microsoft, NCR, Oracle, and SAP are the most popular POS software solution providers. In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment —a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions.</p>

In addition to POS capabilities, it also comes with a Dine-In module to simplify table management, CRM, home delivery management, and live business dashboard. Whether your platform of choice is a traditional, PC-based point of sale system or a tablet POS system, the experts at pcAmerica can custom design a point of sale system to meet the unique needs of your business.</p>
