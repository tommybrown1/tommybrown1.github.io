In short the software makes running the retail store easily and conveniently.</p>

<p>Wasp QuickStore options range from complete POS single store systems to multi-store. The inventory management module embedded in Lightspeed allows the business personnel to carry out their day to day activities in a highly organized manner. For multi-channel retailers who sell online and in physical spaces, applications like Shopify POS and Vend meet the above criteria. Real-time reporting â€” the option to generate real-time business reports, based on product sales and inventory data, is one of the key features that every multi-store retailer needs.</p>
<p>Gift cards continue to be the most requested gift item and a go-to gift idea for the holidays and for businesses. When hooked up to a POS system, the software can track exactly how many times a cash drawer is opened to cut down on fraud.

<p>A restaurant management system helps a restaurant manage all the different types of orders, menus, shifts, tables, billings, payments and everything on all counts. Accurate wait times reduce walk-away customers and no-shows and let diners check-in before arrival. For example, they were responsible for scheduling employee hours and tracking time cards, compiling many tedious manager reports meticulously by hand, tracking all sales, running inventory checks, handling reservations, and generating other necessary reports vital to the operation of the business.</p>
