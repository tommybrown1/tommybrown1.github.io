<p>So when you're at your favorite restaurant or retail shop, and you make a purchase, you are completing a point-of-sale (POS) or a point of purchase (POP) transaction.

<h2>Restaurant POS System, Billing Software Novato</h2>
<p>The best POS systems give you a choice of credit card processing companies to work with, and you'll pay whichever processor you decide to use various fees, such as a percentage of each sale plus a per-transaction fee. You can process payments on your store's floor (especially useful for cutting down lines at the register during busy seasons), at an expo, or at an outdoor pop-up shop. TouchBistro's restaurant POS system features can accommodate small, mid-sized, and large restaurant businesses.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that not all restaurant POS systems are one-size-fits-all solutions. Eliminating a fixed bar POS system can raise a bar's customer experience to new heights by creating a modern sales experience that is rife with today's latest technology. If you need internal security, manage data access with employee passcodes for checking individual sales and refunds. It also offers software for business intelligence, analytics and customer engagement.</p>

Comcash offers cloud-based POS software for retailers and a mobile POS app for the iPhone and iPod Touch that can be used as a line buster in retail stores or to take orders tableside in restaurants. Shifting from traditional front-house cash collection systems to efficient integrated systems with stock management and accounting capabilities, it offer dynamic controls to retailers to help them synchronize stocks with demands.</p>

Square's complete register service is a full point-of-sale solution that offers a suite of tools, from tracking sales and inventory to rich analytics. ShopKeep promises business owners the lowest possible integrated payment processing rate so you can save on every transaction.</p>
<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
<p>Inventory Management: Save your time and money while updating inventories. This kind of management helps avoid conflicts in employee schedules and spots days that are either overstaffed or understaffed.
